      <li>1 yellow onion, finely chopped (~1 1/2 cups)</li>
      <li>2 cloves garlic, minced (~2 tsp.)</li>
      <li>6 oz. Italian sweet sausage</li>

      <li>1 28 oz. can crushed tomatoes</li>

      <li>Kosher salt</li>
      <li>Freshly grated parmesan cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <h3>Saute the onions and garlic</h3>
        <p>
          Heat a tablespoon of extra virgin olive oil in a large skillet on
          medium or medium heat. Add the chopped onion and cook until
          translucent, about 5 minutes. Add the minced garlic and cook 1 minute
          more.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Put the pasta water on to boil</h3>
        <p>
          While the onions are cooking, put a large pot of salted water on to
          boil for the pasta (4 quarts water with 2 tablespoons salt).
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Brown the sausage</h3>
        <p>
          Remove the cooked onion and garlic from the pan and set aside. Remove
          the sausage meat from the casings (if your sausage is in links) and
          add to the pan, breaking up the meat with your fingers as you add it
          to the pan. Cook on medium heat until just lightly browned.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Add the tomatoes, onions, and garlic</h3>
        <p>
          Add crushed or pur√©ed canned tomatoes with their juices to the skillet
          with the sausage meat. Add the cooked onions and garlic. Heat to a
          bare simmer.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Boil the spaghetti</h3>
        <p>
          Once the pasta water has come to a rolling boil, add the spaghetti.
          Allow the water to return to a rolling boil. Cook, uncovered, with a
          vigorous boil, for as long as the directions on the pasta package say,
          usually about 10 to 12 minutes. When pasta is al dente (cooked but
          still a little firm), remove the pot from the heat. Drain the pasta
          and place it in a serving bowl.

          <br />Serve immediately. Toss with the sauce and garnish with grated
          Parmesan cheese.
