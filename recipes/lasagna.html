    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      This is a recipe pulled from SimplyRecipes.com's
      <a href="https://www.simplyrecipes.com/recipes/lasagna"
        >"The Best Homemade Lasagna"</a
      >. Based on a self-written recipe by a man by the name of Alton Hoover,
      this is a minimized version of the lasagna recipe he's been using since
      his college days. Once prepared, this recipe should serve approximately
      eight people.<br />
      This cheesy, slightly sweet rendition of the classic dish is made unique
      by it's addition of some sugar to the sauce combined with a hefty amount
      of extra cheese. This recipe is certain to delight anyone that gets a
      taste!

      <li>1/2 pound dry lasagna noodles (9 lasagna noodles, unbroken)</li>
      <li>15 oz. ricotta cheese</li>

      <li>1/4 lb. freshly grated Parmesan cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <h3>Put pasta on water to boil</h3>
        <p>
          Put a large pot of salted water (1 tablespoon of salt for every 2
          quarts of water) on the stovetop on high heat. It can take a while for
          a large pot of water to come to a boil (this will be your pasta
          water), so prepare the sauce in the next steps while the water is
          heating
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Brown the ground beef</h3>
        <p>
          In a large skillet heat 2 teaspoons of olive oil on medium-high heat.
          Add the ground beef and cook until it is lightly browned on all sides.
          Remove the beef with a slotted spoon to a bowl. Drain off all but a
          tablespoon of fat.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Cook the bell pepper, onions, and garlic; add back the beef</h3>
        <p>
          Add the diced bell pepper and onions to the skillet (in the photo we
          are using yellow bell pepper and red onions).

          <br />Cook for 4 to 5 minutes, until the onions are translucent and
          the peppers softened. Add the minced garlic and cook half a minute
          more.

          <br />Return the browned ground beef to the pan. Stir to combine,
          reduce the heat to low, and cook for another 5 minutes.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Make the sauce</h3>
        <p>
          Transfer the beef mixture to a medium-sized (3- to 4-quart) pot. Add
          the crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, and tomato paste to the pot.

          <br />Add the parsley, oregano, and Italian seasonings, adjusting the
          amounts to taste. Sprinkle with garlic powder and/or garlic salt, to
          taste.

          <br />Sprinkle with red or white wine vinegar. Stir in sugar, a
          tablespoon at a time, tasting after each addition, to taste. (The
          amount of sugar needed will vary, depending on how acidic the tomatoes
          are that you are using.)

          <br />Add salt to taste, and note that you will later be adding
          Parmesan, which is salty.

          <br />Bring the sauce to a simmer and then lower the heat to maintain
          a low simmer. Cook for 15 to 45 minutes, stirring often. Scrape the
          bottom of the pot every so often so nothing sticks to the bottom and
          scorches.

          <br />Remove from heat.
        </p>

        <h3>Boil and drain the lasagna noodles</h3>
        <p>
          By now the salted water you started heating in step one should be
          boiling. Add the dry lasagna noodles and cook them to al dente, per
          package directions. (Note noodles may be cooked in advance.)

          <br />Stir often to prevent from sticking. Make sure that water
          remains at a full rolling boil during the entire cooking to prevent
          noodles from sticking.

          <br />When ready, drain in a colander and rinse with cool water,
          gently separating any noodles that may be sticking together.

          <br />Spread a little olive oil on a large rimmed baking sheet, and
          lay out the cooked noodles on this sheet, turning them over so that
          they get coated with a little of the olive oil. This will prevent them
          from sticking together.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li><h3>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees</h3></li>
      <li>
        <h3>Assemble the lasagna</h3>
        <p>
          In a 9x13-inch casserole or lasagna dish, ladle a cup of sauce and
          spread it over the bottom of the dish. Arrange one layer of lasagna
          noodles lengthwise (about 3 long noodles, the edges may overlap,
          depending on your pan) over the sauce. Ladle a third of the remaining
          sauce over the noodles.

          <br />Sprinkle a layer of a third of the grated mozzarella on top of
          the lasagna sauce. Add half of the ricotta cheese, by placing cheese
          dollops every couple of inches. Sprinkle half the grated parmesan
          cheese evenly over the top of the ricotta cheese.

          <br />Apply the second layer of noodles and top it with half of the
          remaining sauce. Add half of the remaining mozzarella, the remaining
          ricotta cheese, and another the remaining Parmesan.

          <br />Finish with another layer of noodles. Spread the remaining sauce
          over the top layer of noodles and sprinkle with the remaining
          mozzarella cheese.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Bake</h3>
        <p>
          Cover the lasagna pan with aluminum foil, tented slightly so it
          doesn't touch the noodles or sauce. Bake at 375Â°F for 45 minutes.
          Uncover in the last 10 minutes if you'd like more of a crusty top or
          edges.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Cool and serve</h3>
        <p>
          Allow the lasagna to cool for at least 15 before serving. Leftovers
          will keep for about 5 days. You can reheat it in a conventional oven
          or microwave. Leave the aluminum tent on for storage. (Try to keep the
          aluminum foil from touching the sauce.)
